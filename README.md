## 👋 About Me
Hi! I’m **Himal**, a curious and motivated software engineering student who enjoys learning how systems work behind the scenes. I transform ideas into **practical, user-friendly applications** with clean architecture and reliable performance.  

I’m especially interested in:
- Designing interfaces where **UI and logic** work together smoothly  
- Using **object-oriented programming** to build reusable, structured components  
- Understanding how **data flows** through applications  
- Debugging and solving problems that require careful thinking  

To me, programming is like building a system where every part fits perfectly — and learning how to make those pieces fit is what keeps me motivated.
