👋 About Me

Hi! I'm Himal — a developer who enjoys understanding the why behind every line of code. I like building applications that are simple to use, logically organized, and well-structured under the hood.

My learning style is hands-on: I build things, break them, fix them, and iterate until I truly understand how they work. Whether it's shaping a UI, structuring backend logic, or troubleshooting unexpected behavior, I enjoy every part of the process.

I’m especially drawn to:

Writing code that is easy to understand and modify

Organizing projects using solid OOP principles

Designing user-friendly desktop interfaces

Improving performance through careful debugging

Learning how data flows through applications and systems

I'm not just interested in finishing a project — I'm interested in building it the right way.

🛠 Skills & Tools

Languages: Java, Python, C, SQL, JavaScript
Frameworks / Libraries: JavaFX, Tkinter, Swing
Developer Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, PyCharm, Eclipse, Maven
Topics I'm exploring: GUI design, data structures, database systems, clean architecture

📚 What I’m Working On

Right now I’m focused on strengthening the fundamentals that make someone a reliable engineer:

Writing cleaner, more modular Java code

Designing better class structures and relationships

Understanding database concepts and SQL more deeply

Improving my debugging process and documentation

Learning how to build maintainable, long-term codebases

Each week I push myself to learn something new — even small improvements add up over time.

🚀 My Approach to Software

I believe good software should be:

Readable — easy for others to understand

Organized — structured with intention

Efficient — performing well without unnecessary complexity

Maintainable — built in a way that future changes are simple

I’m constantly refining my mindset so every new project becomes stronger than the last.
